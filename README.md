# Foolish Dreams : A Pseudoregalia themed mod 
Foolish dreams is mod attempting to bring Pseudoregalia to Balatro while trying to keep a certain 'Vanilla feel' to it, for now this mod is not complete complete as there's still quite more elements to add, but i  consider adding them progressively as i make the mod.

# What's Pseudoregalia anyway ?
An 3D Metroidvania indie-game made by Rittz. Do i recommand it ? Yes, even if the lore is thin, i do recommand to give a look to a gampelay of the game or better, PLAY IT YOURSELF before playing this mod, but that however you feel like.

# What this mod will have ?
- 54 Jokers (4 being legendaries)
- 1 Tarot Card
- 5 Spectral Cards
- 2 Enhancement type
- 5 Boss Blind
- 9 Vouchers
- 1 Poker Hands

And who knows, mybe there'll be even more.

# How do i instal it ?

1) Instal the Lovely Injector :  https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector
2) Get Steamoded (https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), and put it inside your Balatro save folder (precised in Steamoded's installation guide)
3) Get the most recent release (or an older one for some reason) of the mod, extract it and drop it in the 'Mods' folder of the Balatro folder mentioned in the previous step (If Steammodded was installed correctly, you should see the mod folder)

And you're done ! If you launch the game and see the mod after clicking the Mod button, then everything has been done coretly !

# What if i want to instal an older version of the mod ?

..Why do you want to do that ?

That asside, if you do want to instal an older version of the mod than the latest release, you should download the release folders and instal them manually. **DO NOT** use the source code files as some haven't been properly update when i made the releases so they might be buged or missing elements, or simply being incorect versions. Please instead the zip files attached to it instead (ex : Foolish.Dreams.V.1.4.1.zip)

# WARNING
Talisman will crash some some jokers (like Tower Remains) of the mod due to the way Talisman handle calculations and scoring, however you could still use that mod with it as otherwise there's no major crash or issue, works also with Crytpid.
However, don't report issues about problems related to other mods as i didn't think of the compatibility of other gameplay mods primarly while making this one, sorry !
